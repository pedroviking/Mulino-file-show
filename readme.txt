Browse documents in nested, drag-and-drop-organized folders, with a simple public shortcode and no custom database tables.

== Description ==

Mulino file show is a lightweight document library for WordPress. Organize
documents into nested folders (Decade > Year, Department > Project, or
any hierarchy you like), manage everything with a drag-and-drop admin
screen, and let visitors browse the same structure on your public site
with a single shortcode.

**Admin features**

* Drag and drop files straight from your computer to upload them into a folder
* Drag existing documents or whole folders to re-file them
* Rename or delete folders and documents from the same screen
* Nested folders of unlimited depth

**Frontend features**

* `[mfs_documents]` shortcode shows a breadcrumb-navigable folder browser
* File-type icons (PDF, Word, Excel, images, and more)
* No page reloads needed to browse between folders

**Under the hood**

Mulino file show stores everything using WordPress' own post types and
taxonomies -- no custom database tables, so your data stays portable
and inspectable with standard WordPress tools. It also exposes a small
set of actions and filters for building your own extensions; see
`HOOKS.md` in the plugin's source repository.

This plugin is free and open source. Source code, issue tracker, and
the automated test suite live at:
https://github.com/pedroviking/mulino-file-show

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `mulino-file-show` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install
   through the WordPress plugin screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to **Mulino file show** in the admin menu to create folders and upload
   documents.
4. Add the `[mfs_documents]` shortcode to any page or post to
   show the public folder browser.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to know how to code to use this? =

No. Creating folders, uploading files, and organizing them is all done
by dragging and dropping in the admin screen.

= Can I nest folders as deep as I like? =

Yes, folders can be nested to any depth (e.g. a decade folder
containing year folders, which could themselves contain sub-folders).

= Where are the actual files stored? =

Uploaded files go through WordPress' normal media library, so they end
up in your regular `wp-content/uploads/` folder, organized by upload
date. The folder structure you see in Mulino file show is a separate
organizational layer on top of that, not a real filesystem folder
structure.

= Does deleting a document also delete the uploaded file? =

Not currently. Deleting a document removes it from Mulino file show (moving
it to the trash), but the underlying file remains in your media
library. This may change in a future version.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.0 =
* First release under the name Mulino file show: nested folders, drag-and-drop admin manager, rename/delete support for both folders and documents, frontend shortcode, and extension hooks for building add-ons.
